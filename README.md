<h2>Who am I?</h2>

Hi there, names **Reme** and I spend my working hours on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) projects and before that I spent many years working with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).

Outside of work I really enjoy Mountain Biking, Trail Running, Hiking and in general just being outdoors.

You can take a look at my [website](https://remelehane.dev) for more details
